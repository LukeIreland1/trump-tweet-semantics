## Introduction
    This project revolves around analysing Donald Trump's twitter in various ways to provide interesting insights to his narrative.
    
    Analysis methods include:
        * Frequency Distribution
        * Word Clouds
        * Sentiment Analysis
        * Tweet Generation

    These methods will be presented as a web page via PonyORM
## Background

## Objectives
    1. Perform frequency distribution on variable length phrases
    2. Render word clouds of phrases
    3. Analyse whole tweets for semantics
