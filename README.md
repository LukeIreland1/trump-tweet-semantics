# Trump Tweet Semantics
{::comment}
A *brief* paragraph explaining your project and what it does should be written here. The idea is to give readers an overview of what it is that you've built.
{:/comment}
My project analyses tweets from Donald Trump for positive, neutral and negative semantics. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.5 (or later)
* NLTK
* Tweets in JSON format (http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive)

### Installing

#### Install libraries and run program

```
pip install nltk
python3 main.py
```

### Running Tests
How do I run your tests? Make it as easy as possible to do this! 
Do I actually need tests...?

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./tests.py
```

### Versioning Statergy
What versioning statergy are you using for your project, something like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) might be a good idea.
